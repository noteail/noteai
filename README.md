## 🎯 Philosophy

> *"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

NotesAI is built on a radical belief: **the best software disappears**. It doesn't demand your attention—it amplifies your thoughts. While others chase feature bloat, we pursue the elegance of restraint.

**This is not just another note app.** It's a carefully crafted instrument for thought, where every pixel serves a purpose and every interaction feels inevitable.

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Content First** — UI exists to serve your content, not the other way around
2. **Obvious by Default** — Every action should be discoverable without a manual
3. **Fast is a Feature** — Performance isn't optimized later, it's designed from the start
4. **Accessible Always** — Beautiful for everyone, regardless of ability
5. **Progressive Enhancement** — Works without JavaScript, magical with it

### Guidelines

- Write clean, typed code—TypeScript is not optional
